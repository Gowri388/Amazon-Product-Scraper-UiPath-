# Amazon Product Scraper (UiPath)

This UiPath automation project is developed to efficiently extract structured product information from [Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in) using browser automation and data scraping techniques. The process initiates a keyword-based product search (e.g., *"iPhone"*) and retrieves key data points including product name, price, rating, and availability.

The scraped data is programmatically exported to a formatted Excel spreadsheet, enabling seamless data analysis, market research, price comparison, and competitive tracking. This solution is particularly useful for e-commerce analysts, product managers, and automation developers looking to simplify web data extraction workflows.

## üß© Key UiPath Activities & Workflow Design

The automation leverages several foundational UiPath activities arranged in a clean and modular sequence. The main components of the workflow are as follows:

### üîß Activities Used

- **Sequence**: The base container to structure the logic step-by-step.
- **Use Application/Browser**: Automates interactions within the Amazon webpage using Chrome.
- **Delay**: Introduced between major steps to ensure page elements load completely.
- **Type Into**: Simulates keyboard input into Amazon's search bar based on data from Excel.
- **Extract Data Table**: Used for structured extraction of product details (name, price, ratings).
- **Write Range Workbook**: Writes the extracted data back into `iphonelist.xlsx` in `Sheet1`.

### üí° Highlights

- All selectors are optimized for dynamic content.
- Delay and verification options are used to handle asynchronous page loading.
- Data table is extracted using UiPath‚Äôs Table Extraction Wizard for ease and accuracy.
- Excel interactions are performed using **Workbook activities**, removing the dependency on having Excel installed.
